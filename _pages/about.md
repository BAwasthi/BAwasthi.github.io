I am a current Ph.D. student working under Dr. Xuelian Meng. I received the Bachelor of Engineering in Geomatics Engineering from Kathmandu University, Nepal. My research will focus on multiscale study of the Roseau cane die-off through combination of UAV, satellite imagery, and field surveys at the Mississippi River Delta. I am interested in utilizing modern day machine learning and deep learning techniques in his research. Apart from academics, I like to watch anime, travel and cook.
